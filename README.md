# Employee Attrition Analysis

## About
This repository contains an analysis of employee attrition using a dataset from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to investigate the factors contributing to employee turnover and provide actionable recommendations for Human Reesource Management to reduce attrition rates.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 1,470 rows and 35 columns, which include various employee attributes such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, and personal details. The data has been cleaned for the analysis purpose.

## Key Findings
- **Attrition rate**: The overall attrition rate is 16.12%, which is higher than the industry standard of 10%.
- **Job-associated variables**:
    - Sales Representatives and Laboratory Technicians have the highest attrition rates.
    - Employees with poor work-life balance, low job involvement, and those working overtime are more likely to leave.
- **Personal variables**:
    - Single employees are more likely to leave.
    - Employees with higher education levels (esp., doctoral degree) are less likely to leave.
    - Gender and relationship satisfaction have minimal impact on attrition rates.

## Recommendations
- Emprove work conditions: Enhance work-life balance, job satisfaction, and job involvement to foster a positive work culture
- Focus on career progression, especially for junior employees, to reduce turnover.
- Further investigate the impact of the salary and benefits on attrition to ensure competitive compensation packages.
